OpenAppChat for Firefox OS Open Apps Day Barcelona
====================================================

Apart from the server-side code in node.js, this demo package includes working versions for iOS with Apache Cordova 2.3, Firefox OS and a HTML5 web app served by express.js for the browser. You can run the demo with `node app.js`.

If you like to deploy the node.js application to the cloud, I recommend [nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com), which offers a 30 day free trial. You just need to edit the package.json to your needs.
